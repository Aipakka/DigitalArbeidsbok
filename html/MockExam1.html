Task 1<br><br>
Message A is written in informal language, meanwhile Message B is written in formal language.<br>
One example of why message A is informal is because of this line of text: “Haven´t heard from you in AGES, buddy” is informal due to the word “ages” being spelt in all capital letters, meanwhile in formal language you would most likely add an extra word to emphasize it.
The sentence also contracts “have not” into “haven´t” and this is informal because formal language does not contract words to make the sentence shorter.<br>
Another example in message A is in the sentence: “ My boss says the hotel´s got like major money troubles so we gotta work longer hours” one of the things that makes the text informal is making some statements tentative, one of these examples are “we gotta work longer hours” and this is because he does not specify the extra time he has to work, so for all that we know he might need to work one hour extra or nine hours extra. <br>
The first example in the text “Message B” that I noticed could have been spelled differently in informal language is in the sentence: “I am writing to inform you that I do not wish to renew my contract at the end of this season” the example that I found is “I do not” and this is because if this text would have been written in informal language it would instead have been written as “ I don´t” which uses a contractions, and contractions are much more frequently used in informal language.<br><br>
Another instance where the text could have been different if it would have been written in informal language is in the sentence: “Not least, this job has allowed me to live in the U.S., which has always been my dream” this is because instead of saying “this job has allowed me to live in the U.S., which has always been my dream” he might of said “I got to live In a place where I have always dreamt about living” the second way to write his dream residency is more subjective than the first way which is objective as his dream residency cannot be mistaken as he specifies where it is.<br><br>
In the text written in formal language there are no filler words which are used in a lot of informal text, moreover we see no filler words in the text: “Message B” this is because if we take the time to read through “Message B” we see that most of the give a meaning to the sentence.<br><br>

Task 2<br><br>

Teens deep diving into gaming might go two different ways
Gaming can lead too vast differences in your kids’ lives depending on what they want to do, they might gain a lot of benefits from it or stay completely neutral and not gaining anything but fun and an activity to do with friends, but in the very worst cases gaming might lead to disadvantages in the kids’ lives.<br>
Your children´s social life might be vastly different from your neighbors’ kids’ social life even though they both spend a vast majority of their time gaming. This might be because of the games that they play or because of the communities that they join. This difference might be cause one of the kids might enjoy sending messages and getting to know more and more people in the communities that they join that share interest in the same games that they play. However the other kid might still like to hangout in these communities and play the same games but instead of sending messages and joining voice-chats they might prefer reading all the messages and play the games alone simply because that is what they enjoy more still a sad possibility might be that they want to join but they are too shy or scared to join because they don’t know how the other people that they don’t know yet might react.<br><br>
An example of the “social” was Mats in the text “After Mats Passed Away, His Parents Realised How Special His Gaming Life Was” and this is because after Mats died his parents realized how many friends, he had made in the games that he played and in the communities he joined.
Teens lives may drastically change if they spend most of their time gaming. For example, if you have two kids one playing the game a lot because he is constantly becoming better and better at the game meanwhile the other kid is playing the game so much being he is simply addicted to the game and does not at all want to spend their time on anything else even though he is very bad at the game. The first kid in the example might end up becoming so good at the game that he manages to get on an E-sport team. If this instance where he joins an E-sports team is true then this kid will most likely have a very good life because there is a lot of money to be earned in E-sport if you win a lot, and if he is winning a lot of these games that he is playing he might also get famous and get a lot of sponsors that pay him money. When he then stops playing E-sports there is a very good chance that he never has to work ever again if he manages his economy well so that he could live well for the rest of his lifespan.<br><br> 
On the other hand, the second kid in the example might get a very bad life because when he is addicted to the game there is a good chance that he forgets to eat and sleep, so that his body slowly but surely malfunctions, and he dies. This instance is very extreme but so is it with all other addictions, being addicted to something over a very long time often leads to bad thing. But for most kids neither of these rare situations ever happen simply because they don’t bother to improve at the game or because they have people who look after them so that they don’t get too addicted to the game.
In conclusion gaming can be vastly different for your child depending on who they are as a person, they might be very social meanwhile being addicted to videogames, or they might
not be as social meanwhile playing competitively, there are extremely many ways your kid might choose to spend their time meanwhile being on the internet and gaming.
